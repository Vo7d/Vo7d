Hey there! I'm vo7d, a passionate gamer, programmer, skateboarder, beerdrinker, homelab enthusiast and 3D printing technician. This is the place where I bring together my hobbies, skills, and projects. Here’s a bit about me and what I’m up to:

---

## 🕹️ Gamer at Heart
When I'm not coding or 3d printing, you'll probably find me immersed in the world of gaming. Whether it's tackling challenging single-player campaigns, strategizing in multiplayer games, or exploring indie titles, gaming is where I recharge and find inspiration.

## 💻 Programmer
I'm passionate about turning ideas into code. I enjoy working on:

- **Game Development:** Creating small games and interactive experiences.
- **Automation:** Writing scripts to make my workflow faster and easier.
- **Web Development:** Building functional, responsive websites and web apps.
